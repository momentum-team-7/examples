          <h3>Wild hyacinth</h3>

            <p>
              This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best
              in well-drained soil high in humus. It will grow in lightly shaded
              forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or
              prairies. Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and
              rivers. The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have
              withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. Additionally the
              plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.

              With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that dangle
              above bright emerald-green leaves -- this nearly deer-proof shade
              lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. But the
              pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and
              rapidly, and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to
              watch this perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. Tolerates
              shade well. <strong>Warning: this plant is poisonous.</strong>

          <h3>Crown imperials</h3>

          <img class="plant-photo" src="images/crown-imperials.jpg" alt="Crown imperials" />
          <div>
            Crown imperials are strong-growing bulbous plants, making rapid
            growth in the spring, flowering during April/early May and dying
            down in early summer. Best in raised beds or planters. Does not
            tolerate shade; needs a warm, sunny position where it can be left
            undisturbed for many years.

          <h3>Persian buttercup</h3>

          <img class="plant-photo" src="images/persian-buttercup.jpg" alt="Persian buttercup" />
          <div>
            This species of buttercup can get up to 2 feet tall and has large
            showy blooms in a variety of colors from May to June. Persian
            buttercups are most commonly grown from tubers planted in the
            beginning of spring. Each plant will produce up to 70 blooms in a
            season. Good for cooler weather; can tolerate light frost.

          <h3>Spring starflower</h3>
          <img class="plant-photo" src="images/spring-starflower.jpg" alt="Spring starflower" />

          <div>
            These charming little blooming plants hail from Argentina and
            Uruguay and form dense clumps of perennial flowers to chase the
            winter doldrums away. These flowers spring from fall planted bulbs.
            They can get up to half a foot tall with a similar spread. Each bulb
            will produce numerous flowering stems with slender, deeply green
            foliage. Blooms are fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white
            petals.

          <h3>Tulips</h3>
          <img class="plant-photo" src="images/tulips.jpg" alt="Tulips" />
          <div>
            We have a wide variety of tulips in many colors. Plant tulip bulbs
            in the fall, 6 to 8 weeks before a hard frost is expected and when
            soils are below 60 degrees F.
