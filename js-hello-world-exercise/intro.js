// Intro JS exercise
console.log('oh hai! Welcome to the console!')
console.log('You can run JavaScript directly here.')
console.log('You can also log any output from your JavaScript files.')

// Read carefully and uncomment the necessary lines one at a time as you run the code (Command-/ with your cursor on the line).

// 1. What does `firstName` evaluate to on this line? Console.log to find out.
let firstName = 'Jamal'
// Write your console.log statement here

// 2. Below, a new value is assigned to the firstName variable.
// What does `firstName` evaluate to after reassignment?
// Uncomment the following lines and see what it is with console.log:
// firstName = "Avery"
// console.log("The firstName variable now has an assigned value of ", firstName)

// 3. What is happening here? Use console.log() to check if you're right.
// TODO: Uncomment the following lines:
// let name = firstName
// console.log("The name variable evaluates to ", name)

// 4. Assign a value to the `greeting` variable that is a string that represents a greeting, and log it to the console.
let greeting

// 5. Combine the `greeting` and `name` variables to output a personalized greeting. Log it to the console.
// Write your code here

// 6. What does `result` evaluate to?
// Uncomment the following lines and use console.log() to check what value is stored in the variable `result`
// let num1 = 50
// let num2  = 10
// let result = num1 - num2

// 7. What will `result` return here? Read this code carefully.
// Log it to the console to find out what happens.
// Uncomment the following line:
// result = num1 - "5"

// 8. Create a variable to calculate the total number of tacos and burritos.
// Log to the console a sentence that tells the user the total number, for instance:
