# Hello, World!

## JS Edition

The main.js file contains examples of expressions that you can output to the console using `console.log`.

To get started, open `index.html` in the browser, open the dev tools, and click on the console tab.

In your code editor, open `intro.js` and work on the exercises in there. Uncomment the necessary lines as you work your way through each numbered exercise and run each one.

There is also a `conditionals.js` file with more exercises. To work on those, link that file to your html page.
